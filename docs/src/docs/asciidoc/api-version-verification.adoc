== API version verification

Platforms are required to provide an https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#api-version-header[HTTP header] in each call to the Open Service Broker API, indicating the version of the API specification that the platform supports.
Spring Cloud Open Service Broker can be configured to verify the version provided by the platform on each call to the service broker.
This version verification is configured to allow any API version by default.

To customize the version verification, provide a Spring bean that specifies the API version required by the service broker, as in this example:

[source,java,%autofit]
----
include::{examples-dir}/ExampleApiVersionConfiguration.java[]
----

If an API version is specified and the platform provides a different version in the `X-Broker-API-Version` header, the framework will return a `412 Precondition Failed` error to the platform.
